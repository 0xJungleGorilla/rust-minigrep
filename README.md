## Rust Learning

This project is the result of `Chapter 12: An I/O Project: Building a Command Line Program` from [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch12-00-an-io-project.html) book.
It demonstrates the basic knowledge from the previous chapters by walking through building the CLI program in `main.rs`, refactoring it into structs & functions, then into a separate library, and then, through test-driven development (TDD), creating basic unit tests and implementing additional functionality (case-insensitive search configured through environment variables).
